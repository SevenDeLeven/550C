# Description
This repo is the code for team 550C of the 2018-2019 Vex Robotics Competition. Use of this code is permitted without need for reference or credit, although appreciated. This was developed as a way for myself and other teams to easily create a consistent and understandable autonomous program.

# Development
This project was created using the PROS editor by Purdue University.

# Documentation
Documentation will be available soon, depending on time.

# V5
Vex V5 is arriving soon, and so this library and project as a whole will not be worked on in the near future. Some parts of the original library will be transferred over, such as digital and analog sensors, but other parts are deprecated and will not be used.
